# Rustlings ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è - Completed by Scott Boyce

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) provides a set of teaching examples for Rust. This repository initial commit was created from the compiled rustling executable and each subsequent commit are my personal attempt as solving each of the exercises. This repository is not meant for any specific use, outside of my personal enrichment of Rust.
